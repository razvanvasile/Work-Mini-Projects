# Work-Mini-Projects
Introductory exercises to the aphla library written in Python.
The library is used to access properties of different elements in the synchrotron.

The matlab folder consists of the same exercise, written in Matlab using 
Matlab Middle Layer (used for real data) and Accelerator Toolbox (used for simulations).

Additional Pytac scripts were added that complement the Python Toolkit for Accelerator Controls library which can be found here_.
